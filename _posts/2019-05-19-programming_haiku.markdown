Stuck on one last error,  
Existential crisis sets in.  
Oh, forgot to save.  

Over cocktails  
I talk ad nauseum of code.  
No one else cares.  

The longer I code  
The more I try to refactor  
Everything I encounter.  

I sleep less these days,  
Coding late into the night and  
On into my dreams.  

Each problem I have  
In life I instantly wonder:  
How could an app solve it?  

Boolean is great:  
A tool to reduce complexity.  
Sadly, “real” life doesn’t always abide.  

The more time spent coding  
The less digital and analog  
Seem distinct.  

Belongs to? Has many?  
I ask this daily for orientation.  
Thanks, Ruby.  

Feynman says to truly  
Understand, teach it to a child.  
He’s right.
