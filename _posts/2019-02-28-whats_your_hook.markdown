In undergrad, back in the early-aughts, I got by without a computer. I made use of the various computer labs on campus and at the library but otherwise operated PC-free. I was, honestly, kind of a luddite, utilizing technology only for the bare essentials. I think this is what makes my path to Flatiron School rather interesting.

Technology is built for people. At least it’s suppose to be. However essential digital literacy is to functioning in the present world, there remains much resistance--even animosity--toward hard and software alike. Why is that? Is it the age old “fear of change” that seems somehow programmed into our biology? That certainly a factor. But I also think it’s because technology is often unintuitive and, occasionally, downright inhuman. It can be difficult to relate to software programs.

Something I realized over my dozen years working in libraries is that everyone needs a hook to get them, well, *hooked* on using technology. This can be finding a software program or digital tool that simplifies and/or adds real, demonstrative value to their life and work. Or maybe it’s the empowerment that stems from learning a new tech skill, knowing that you no longer need to rely on that “tech-y” friend or relative to bail you out every time you need to update your OS or balance your budget in Excel. In my case, it was realizing that, with right knowledge, I could become my own record producer and no longer be reliant on others (and on the hook for massive studio fees) to document and share my sounds. I finally had a personal tie--a truly compelling reason--to deeply engage with software.

What started, for me, with Garageband led to basic web development--building a website to promote my music. From there, I found myself teaching computer classes and running a digital makerspace in a public library. And now I find myself behind the scenes, learning to build the kinds of programs that have enriched my life.

So, as I progress through this program, and, eventually, on into my career in software development, I aim to always be circling back to this idea: *technology is built for people*.
